# Soomatic - Frontend Project

## Overview
Soomatic website simulates the real experience of famous fitness websites or a blogs we can even say. The user get to know all the important articles and advices about workout, supplements, weight loss and many more interesting subjects, Also the user get to read some of the testimonials and then decide if he/she wants to sign up and become a member. The goal of this project is that I wanted to practice and apply all those core features of web rules and design that I studied so far, also practice more with JS and do some advance DOM manipulation.
